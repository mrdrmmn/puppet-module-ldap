ldap

This module functions as a define and create one or more ldap directories on
a single OpenLDAP instance.  It can also be used to configure multiple servers
running OpenLDAP in an N-way master configuration.

This module has been tested and functions on the following platforms:
  Amazon Linux AMI 2011.02.1 Beta (EC2 instances)
  Debian 6.0
  Ubuntu 10.04
  Ubuntu 11.04
  Fedora 15

If you are setting up multiple servers replicating to each other, you will
need to be careful that OpenLDAP was compiled againts the same SSL engine
(openssl or gnutls).  The reason for this is that the cipher list format
between openssl and gnutls is different and incompatible and this module
replicates the config database as well.  Right now, I don't know of a way
around this other that not replicating the config which is not ideal.
